<h2 id="quotes">QUOTES:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I prefer to use it in Microsoft Word because it gives me access to
other tools like Zotero and other referencing managers that I happen to
use in Word.</li>
<li>Itâ€™s really really useful if youâ€™re in the pointy end of
submission.</li>
<li>Itâ€™s just a little bit too distracting to get all of the information
out of your brain and then start refining it.</li>
<li>Revolutionize to revolutionize um and solar energy is harness
instead of we harness energy Iâ€™ll accept that.</li>
<li>This is not just for writing now the co-pilot opens up the door to
getting academic sort of advice.</li>
<li>Itâ€™s generally a little bit too lackluster because it doesnâ€™t know
the ins and outs of Academia but it does give you a great place to start
thinking about how to approach the issues youâ€™re having.</li>
<li>The literature provides a limited perspective on the application of
solution process methods for the manufacturer thatâ€™s fine yeah okay fine
it just makes it a little bit more boring I think.</li>
<li>Addressing the degradation mechanisms yeah I like that I like
that.</li>
<li>The one thing I like about this generate thing is it is all of the
little boring stuff that quite often just sucks up loads of your time
for no reason.</li>
<li>This is kind of a cool little thing so Iâ€™ve done outlines letâ€™s say
that I actually want a title for this paper I donâ€™t really know what it
is at the moment.</li>
<li>All of these things quite often just take up so much time now
theyâ€™re just at the click of a button.</li>
<li>Overall weâ€™ve got a similarity of 11% which is fantastic so that
tells me that yeah this is uh suitable for publishing and submission to
a journal.</li>
<li>This is what I really like here this is where it tells you um all of
the things things that it thinks you should change.</li>
<li>I put in this paper because it was already in the format that the
journal article wanted it in and you can see it navigated the columns
really well and itâ€™s given me loads of suggestions on the different
spelling and grammatical changes it would make but it also has
comments.</li>
