<h2 id="summary">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>M. Kov, an academic English expert, compares two AI writing tools,
Jenny AI and Paperpile, highlighting their benefits and drawbacks for
academic writing.</p>
<h2 id="ideas">IDEAS:</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI tools like Jenny AI and Paperpile promise to revolutionize
academic writing.</li>
<li>Jenny AI and Paperpile offer similar features like paraphrasing,
simplifying, and expanding text.</li>
<li>Jenny AI allows users to upload PDFs to a library, improving AIâ€™s
accuracy in generating references.</li>
<li>Jenny AI provides a built-in AI chat assistant, answering questions
and providing references.</li>
<li>Paperpile integrates with Microsoft Word, allowing users to continue
using their existing software.</li>
<li>Paperpile offers a text scanning feature, suggesting improvements
for grammar and style.</li>
<li>Jenny AIâ€™s sentence suggestion feature can be problematic as it can
lead to plagiarism.</li>
<li>Both tools offer plagiarism checkers, with Paperpile partnering with
Turnitin.</li>
<li>Jenny AIâ€™s sentence suggestion feature can be helpful but should be
used with caution.</li>
<li>Using AI to improve text readability, grammar, and structure is
generally acceptable.</li>
<li>Using AI to generate whole texts can lead to plagiarism and ethical
concerns.</li>
<li>Researchers should rely on their own knowledge and skills to
validate AI-generated outputs.</li>
<li>Both tools have free and paid plans, with discounts offered for new
users.</li>
<li>Jenny AI and Paperpile are not perfect substitutes for professional
editing services.</li>
<li>Both tools require users to understand their limitations and use
them ethically.</li>
<li>Both tools can help users overcome writerâ€™s block and improve their
writing efficiency.</li>
<li>AI tools can be helpful in academic writing but should be used
judiciously and ethically.</li>
<li>AI tools are not a replacement for human critical thinking and
writing skills.</li>
<li>Researchers should prioritize developing their own writing skills to
achieve success in academic publishing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="insights">INSIGHTS:</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI is increasingly impacting academic writing, posing both
opportunities and challenges.</li>
<li>AI tools can accelerate the writing process but cannot replace human
judgment and creativity.</li>
<li>Ethical considerations should guide the use of AI in academic
writing, particularly regarding plagiarism.</li>
<li>Developing strong writing skills remains essential for academic
success, regardless of the availability of AI tools.</li>
<li>Researchers must be discerning in evaluating and validating
AI-generated outputs.</li>
<li>AI tools can be valuable for specific tasks but should not be solely
relied upon for complex academic work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quotes">QUOTES:</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI tools like Jenny AI and Paperpile promise to revolutionize
academic writing.</li>
<li>Both tools make a big promise that they they are basically the
future of academic writing and that they can supercharge your
writing.</li>
<li>AI should be used to improve the readability of your text that means
AI should be used in the same sense that proof reading services are used
for example to improve your grammar.</li>
<li>AI should not be used to generate text.</li>
<li>You still have to kind of review it many of those suggestions will
be correct but not all of them right so you still have to review it
nevertheless I think this is a fantastic feature to scan your text and
correct most of the sort of most obvious mistakes.</li>
<li>The more PDFs you upload to your library the better answers Jenny
will actually give you.</li>
<li>The sentences are actually pretty good they make sense the text
actually flows pretty well so I think itâ€™s a really cool feature and you
know itâ€™s a clear winner over paperpile but at the same time this is
very problematic because youâ€™re using AI to write a text for you.</li>
<li>Youâ€™re using AI to write a text for you now if you go to any good
journals recommendations for AI use what you will find is that AI should
be used to improve the readability of your text.</li>
<li>If youâ€™re worried about you know the use of AI I think PayPal with
just using it for you know for scanning your text and correct correting
your mistakes with the language or consistency is much safer this is not
going to lead to plagiarism.</li>
<li>It might lead to a lot of plagiarism if youâ€™re not careful.</li>
<li>This is not going to lead to plagiarism if youâ€™re using Genny AI
please make sure that you donâ€™t just accept all the sentences that she
gives you and treat them as your own cuz theyâ€™re not your own they were
generated by Jenny Ai.</li>
<li>I think this is a great um feature to have it itâ€™s a shame I think
that Jenny AI uh took it out surely they could partner with turn it in
as well and have that feature build in here.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="habits">HABITS:</h2>

block.</li>
